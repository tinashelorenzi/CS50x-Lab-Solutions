To characterize an audio aura based on the name of the music listened to, as well as the song's intrinsic energy, interaction, and dance, you can analyze all trends and appearances in these elements Here's a high -level way to characterize an audio aura:

    Data Collection: Calculate the energy, coordination, and danceability of the entire repertoire. This will help us to understand all that is happening.

    Analyze the intensity: A high average intensity indicates that you prefer more energetic and upbeat music. This can mean an audible aura that is outward and pleasant. On the other hand, if the average power level is low, it may reflect more soothing and pleasant music, indicating a relaxed and immersive state of audio

    Assess valence: valence represents the musical positivity of the song. A high average valence indicates a preference for good and uplifting music, indicating an upbeat and optimistic audio glow. Low average interaction may indicate a preference for music with deep emotion or a subtle and introspective audio aura.

    Consider danceability: Danceability measures the danceability of a song based on genres. High average dancing ability can indicate a preference for energetic and rhythmic music, which exhibits a lively and dynamic aura. A lower average dance skill may indicate a preference for more rhythmic or contemplative music.

The best way to calculate the audio aurora is probably a psychological assessment of the user to see their likelihood to play
a certain song.
